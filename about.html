    <p>I studied IT at College of Cape-Town for 3 years, i completed the course in 2021,</br>
        I have a responsive web design certification which can be viewed <a href= "https://www.freecodecamp.org/ASCharles">here.</a></br>
        Prior to my It NCV level 4 certification, I completed the memorization of the Qur'an after 4 years at
        Madrasatun'Nur, </br>
        I also have a Level 2 mechanical engineering certification. At a young age I've always been passionate about
        breaking things and putting them back together, </br>
        I do not know why, It was just exciting to me. When I first started, I had no idea how to program or do anything
        technical,</br>
        but because of my excellent teachers I slowly started to learn how to do it, I became good at it and began to
        develop a passion for it. <br>
        Now I find myself eager to learn more about the vast world of Software Development.</p>
